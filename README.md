# **Terrible-Tarot**
A *Codecademy* Portfolio Project.

For this project, I had to build a message generator program. Everytime a user runs the program a new, randomised message needs to display.

### The Project Objectives:
* Build a message generator program using JavaScript.
* Use Git version control.
* Use command line.
* Develop locally on your computer.

I opted to build a tarot card reading game in which the user selects three cards. The cards are then flipped over to reveal images as well as the users 'fortune'. I have tried to make the fortunes as non-sensical as possible. Offense is not intended.
